# Waste Facility Research

Files used to aggregate comprehensive data on public and private waste, transfer, collection, and recycling facilities in all 50 states with data from government databases, the Google Places API, ArcGIS data, and web scraping off various websites. Each state has a slightly modified R file to account for differences in the disparate ways that information is stored state by state. Collected data cross-applied with census data by locality to identify gaps in market availability.
